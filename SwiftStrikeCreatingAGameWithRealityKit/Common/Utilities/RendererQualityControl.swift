         The logic below is based on the following observation:
         1. iPhones have smaller screens with high DPI, so upsampling artifacts
         will be very small on screen. Additionally, rendering at a resolution higher than
         the camera feed is not an economical way to use resources when we are
         already required to continually refresh.

         2. On any iOS device, if we are outside of nominal thermal state, we should
         cut back on how much render work we are doing.

         3. Old devices do a lot better with just fewer pixels on screen (of course)
